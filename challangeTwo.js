// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement ï¿½
